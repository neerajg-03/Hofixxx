# Service Completion and Payment Workflow

This document describes the complete service completion workflow implemented in the HooFix application, including provider upload functionality, user feedback system, and Razorpay payment integration.

## Overview

The workflow enables providers to upload service completion details and images, allows users to provide feedback and ratings, and integrates Razorpay for secure payments after service completion.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Service Completion Upload (Provider Side)

**New Models:**
- `ServiceCompletion`: Tracks completion uploads with notes and images
- Updated `Booking` model with completion fields:
  - `completion_notes`: Provider's completion notes
  - `completion_images`: URLs of uploaded completion images
  - `completed_at`: Timestamp when service was completed
  - `review`: User's review text
  - `rating`: User's rating (1-5 stars)

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /completion/upload` - Upload service completion with images
- `GET /completion/<booking_id>` - Get completion details for a booking

**Provider Dashboard Features:**
- Job status management (Accept → Start → Complete)
- Service completion modal with image upload
- Real-time notifications for job updates

### 2. User Feedback and Rating System

**Enhanced Rating System:**
- Star-based rating (1-5 stars)
- Optional text review
- Real-time rating updates
- Provider average rating calculation

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /bookings/<booking_id>/rate` - Submit rating and review
- Enhanced booking serialization with rating and review data

**User Dashboard Features:**
- Rating modal with star interface
- Review text input
- Visual feedback for rated services
- Payment status indicators

### 3. Razorpay Payment Integration

**Payment Model Updates:**
- Added Razorpay-specific fields:
  - `razorpay_payment_id`
  - `razorpay_order_id`
  - `razorpay_signature`
- Updated payment methods to include 'Razorpay'
- Changed default payment status to 'Pending'

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /payments/razorpay/create-order` - Create Razorpay order
- `POST /payments/razorpay/verify` - Verify payment signature
- `GET /payments/<booking_id>/status` - Get payment status

**Payment Flow:**
1. User clicks "Make Payment" on completed service
2. System creates Razorpay order
3. Razorpay checkout opens
4. Payment verification on success
5. Real-time notifications to both parties

### 4. Real-time Notifications

**Socket.IO Events:**
- `service_completed` - Notify user when service is completed
- `completion_uploaded` - Notify provider of successful upload
- `payment_received` - Notify provider of successful payment
- `payment_successful` - Notify user of successful payment
- `booking_rated` - Notify provider of new rating

## Workflow Steps

### Provider Workflow

1. **Accept Booking**: Provider accepts incoming booking request
2. **Start Job**: Provider marks job as "In Progress"
3. **Complete Service**: Provider uploads completion details and images
4. **Receive Payment**: Provider gets notified when payment is made

### User Workflow

1. **Service Completion**: User receives notification when service is completed
2. **View Completion**: User can view completion details and images
3. **Rate Service**: User provides rating and optional review
4. **Make Payment**: User pays for completed service via Razorpay
5. **Payment Confirmation**: User receives payment confirmation

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
# Razorpay Configuration
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_your_key_id_here
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_secret_key_here

# Other existing variables...
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-jwt-secret
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/hofix
```

### Razorpay Setup

1. Sign up for Razorpay account
2. Get API keys from Razorpay dashboard
3. Add keys to environment variables
4. Test with Razorpay test mode

## Usage Examples

### Provider Completing Service

```javascript
// Provider clicks "Complete Service" button
window.completeJob = function(jobId) {
    // Opens modal with completion form
    // Allows upload of images and notes
    // Submits to /completion/upload endpoint
};
```

// User clicks "Make Payment" button
window.makePayment = async function(bookingId) {
    // Creates Razorpay order
    // Opens Razorpay checkout
    // Verifies payment on success
};
```
